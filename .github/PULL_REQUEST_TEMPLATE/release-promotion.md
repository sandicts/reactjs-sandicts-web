## Summary

Promotes the reviewed release from `REPLACE_WITH_SOURCE_BRANCH` to
`REPLACE_WITH_TARGET_BRANCH`.

## Problem

The target environment must receive one auditable, immutable commit range only
after the source branch passes the complete repository CI.

## Root cause

The source branch contains changes approved for the next environment and the
target branch does not contain that release yet.

## Changes

- Release type: `REPLACE_WITH_standard_security_or_rollback`
- Promotion path: `REPLACE_WITH_developer_to_staging_or_staging_to_master`
- Source commit: `REPLACE_WITH_FULL_GIT_SHA`
- Target environment: `REPLACE_WITH_preview_or_production`
- Included Jira issues: `REPLACE_WITH_JIRA_KEYS_OR_RELEASE_TASK`

## Files added or updated

- Compare range: `REPLACE_WITH_COMPARE_URL_OR_GIT_RANGE`
- Application files are unchanged by this promotion PR; it promotes the exact
  source-branch state.

## Impact

### Fixed

- Delivers the approved source commit to the next environment.
- Preserves the `developer -> staging -> master` promotion order.

### Not changed

- No direct commit is made to the target branch.
- No deployment occurs before this PR is merged and post-merge CI succeeds.
