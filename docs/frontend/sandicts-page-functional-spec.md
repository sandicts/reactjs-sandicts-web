# Sandicts Page Functional Specification

## Purpose

This document consolidates the page and flow descriptions provided by the user
into a functional page specification.

It intentionally focuses on:

- user roles
- pages
- page behavior
- business rules
- permissions
- open decisions
- MVP, V2, and future placement

It intentionally does not treat architecture suggestions from the source summary
as final decisions. Architecture, stack, state management, repository layout, and
implementation patterns must be decided separately.

Current frontend stack decisions live in
`docs/frontend/sandicts-frontend-tech-decisions.md`. Delivery sequencing,
prototype tasks, documentation tasks, and implementation gates live in
`docs/frontend/sandicts-mvp-delivery-roadmap.md`.

## How To Use This Document

Use this document before creating Jira Epics, Stories, Tasks, or Subtasks for
frontend and fullstack work.

Planning order:

1. read the MVP and business-rule docs
2. read this page spec
3. classify each page as MVP, V2, future, or open decision
4. define the route and user flow
5. define the backend contract needed by the page
6. create Jira issues only after the user approves the batch

This document is a working draft. When a rule becomes a backend invariant, copy
or reconcile it into `sandicts/nodejs-sandicts-api:docs/ai/business/sandicts-business-rules.md` or the MVP
scope docs as appropriate.

## Scope Classification

Use these labels:

- `MVP`: confirmed by current MVP scope or necessary for the MVP flow
- `MVP candidate`: useful for MVP, but needs explicit product confirmation
- `V2`: confirmed or strongly aligned with V2 scope
- `Future`: later than V2 or explicitly excluded from MVP
- `Open decision`: cannot be classified safely yet

Important current MVP constraints:

- geolocation is not MVP
- tournaments are not MVP
- full school ERP is not MVP
- students, memberships, teachers, and classes are V2
- payment gateway, split, and payout automation are not MVP
- player evolution, card, overall, rankings, and achievements are not MVP
- manual reservation payment status is MVP
- player-created open matches are MVP

## Roles

## Next Step Before Jira

Before creating Jira issues, use this document to produce a page inventory batch:

1. confirm MVP pages
2. confirm V2 pages
3. resolve the most important open decisions
4. define the first fullstack route/API slices
5. only then create Epics, Stories, Tasks, and Subtasks in Jira
