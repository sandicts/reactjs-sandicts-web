# Sandicts MVP Delivery Roadmap

## Purpose

This document starts the delivery roadmap for the final Sandicts MVP.

It turns frontend decisions, business rules, screen specs, documentation work,
prototype work, and implementation work into explicit roadmap categories.

The key rule:

> Do not treat research, decisions, prototypes, docs, architecture, and
> integration gates as invisible work. They are part of MVP delivery.

## Roadmap Principles

- build the MVP in vertical slices after auth
- keep backend and frontend work connected through API contracts
- create roadmap anchors for the whole MVP, but detail only the current and next
  module
- do not implement a page before its first shippable prototype or wireflow is
  approved enough to build
- do not mark a module complete until its integration gate is validated
- keep docs aligned with product decisions instead of relying on chat history
- keep V2 ideas documented, but prevent them from expanding MVP scope

## Work Types

Use these work types in Jira and roadmap planning.

### Decision Task

Use when the product, UX, architecture, or API shape is not decided.

Title examples:

- `[Spike] Decide frontend repository location`
- `[UX] Decide player, organization, academy, and Admin App navigation model`
- `[Spike] Decide reservation cancellation window`
- `[Frontend] Decide OpenAPI client generator`

Output:

- decision recorded in the relevant doc
- follow-up tasks created only when needed

### Prototype Task

Use before implementing a page, major component, or unclear flow.

Title examples:

- `[UX] Prototype player profile onboarding`
- `[UX] Prototype court discovery mobile flow`
- `[UX] Prototype organization agenda day and week views`
- `[UX] Prototype reservation request and status flow`

Output:

- Figma, wireflow, screenshot, or documented prototype direction
- open decisions resolved or listed
- page spec updated when behavior changes

### Documentation Task

Use when docs need to capture a decision, spec, or delivery rule.

Title examples:

- `[Docs] Document frontend technology decisions`
- `[Docs] Align MVP frontend roadmap`
- `[Docs] Capture approved discovery prototype decisions`
- `[Docs] Reconcile uncommitted MVP documentation`

Output:

- updated docs in `docs/frontend` or
  `sandicts/nodejs-sandicts-api:docs/ai`
- links added to index or related docs when needed
- unresolved decisions kept visible

### Foundation Task

Use for setup that supports many features but is not a user story.

Title examples:

- `[Frontend] Create Next.js app foundation`
- `[Frontend] Configure shadcn/ui and Tailwind tokens`
- `[Frontend] Configure TanStack Query`
- `[Frontend] Configure generated OpenAPI client`
- `[Frontend] Configure Playwright and Vitest`

Output:

- runnable frontend foundation
- repeatable scripts
- baseline architecture rules
- first reusable states/components

### Feature Story

Use when the issue delivers visible user value.

Title examples:

- `[Players] Player manages a basic profile`
- `[Courts] Organization creates a court`
- `[Reservations] Player requests a court reservation`
- `[Open Matches] Player joins an open match`

Output:

- backend behavior when needed
- frontend behavior when needed
- docs updated when behavior changes
- integration gate validated

## Pre-Implementation Rule For Pages

Before starting any MVP page or major component, create or complete this chain:

1. decision task for unresolved product/UX/API questions
2. prototype task for the page or flow
3. documentation task to capture approved behavior
4. API contract task or mock-contract task
5. frontend implementation task
6. integrated validation task

This rule applies to:

- sign-in
- player home
- player profile onboarding/editing
- discovery
- court detail
- reservation request
- reservation history/detail
- open match list/detail/create
- organization setup
- organization dashboard
- court management
- availability calendar
- agenda day/week
- organization reservation detail
- manual payments

## Phase 0: Documentation And Roadmap Foundation

Purpose:

- make the MVP delivery system explicit before creating many implementation
  issues

Suggested tasks:

- `[Docs] Document frontend technology decisions`
- `[Docs] Align MVP frontend roadmap`
- `[Docs] Reconcile uncommitted MVP documentation`
- `[Docs] Update AI index with frontend roadmap docs`
- `[Jira] Create MVP roadmap anchor epics`
- `[Jira] Add decision, prototype, docs, and integration task conventions`

Exit criteria:

- frontend stack decisions are documented
- roadmap includes decision/prototype/docs tasks
- docs list the main open decisions
- Jira workflow can represent non-feature work clearly

## Phase 1: Frontend App Foundation

Purpose:

- create the base app that all MVP pages will use

Decision tasks:

- `[Spike] Decide frontend repository location`
- `[Frontend] Decide package manager and Node.js version`
- `[Frontend] Decide OpenAPI client generator`
- `[DevOps] Decide frontend deployment target`
- `[UX] Decide player, organization, academy, and Admin App navigation model`
- `[UX] Decide mobile navigation model`

Prototype tasks:

- `[UX] Prototype public, player, organization, academy, and Admin App shells`
- `[Design] Prototype Sandicts visual tokens and base components`
- `[UX] Prototype global loading, empty, error, forbidden, and not-found states`

Implementation tasks:

- `[Frontend] Create Next.js App Router project`
- `[Frontend] Configure TypeScript, lint, format, and path aliases`
- `[Frontend] Configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui`
- `[Frontend] Configure lucide-react icon usage`
- `[Frontend] Configure TanStack Query`
- `[Frontend] Configure generated OpenAPI client workflow`
- `[Frontend] Configure React Hook Form and Zod patterns`
- `[Frontend] Configure Zustand local UI state boundary`
- `[Frontend] Configure Playwright`
- `[Frontend] Configure Vitest and Testing Library`
- `[Frontend] Build public, player, organization, academy, and Admin App layout shells`
- `[Frontend] Build reusable base states and status badges`

Exit criteria:

- frontend runs locally
- backend URL and credentials behavior are configurable
- base app areas exist
- base state components exist
- test commands exist
- architecture rules are documented

## Phase 2: Auth Integration

Purpose:

- prove real backend and frontend session integration

Decision tasks:

- `[Frontend] Decide auth session hydration flow`
- `[UX] Decide expired session experience`
- `[UX] Decide post-login routing`
- `[UX] Decide Google One Tap placement and fallback behavior`

Selected auth session hydration flow:

- client bootstrap attempts `POST /auth/refresh` with `credentials: 'include'`
  to recover an access token from the backend-owned refresh cookie
- successful Google sign-in, refresh, and future magic-link consume responses
  hydrate the same in-memory snapshot: `{ account, session, accessToken,
  accessTokenExpiresAt }`
- the current-session TanStack Query uses `GET /auth/me` when an access token
  exists and stores only the public `{ account, session }` projection
- protected-route behavior is implemented by client auth boundaries or layouts,
  not by Next.js middleware as the MVP source of auth truth

Selected Google One Tap placement and fallback:

- `/`, `/discovery`, and `/sign-in` are eligible, with one attempt on the first
  eligible route visited per browser tab
- public detail pages remain ineligible until explicitly added to the central
  route policy
- protected layouts never initialize One Tap
- desktop Chromium/Edge and Android Chromium use One Tap; iOS, Safari/ITP,
  Firefox, and webviews use the explicit fallback
- skipped, cancelled, and failed credential exchanges suppress automatic
  prompting for 24 hours while `/sign-in` keeps the explicit Google button
- the implementation contract lives in
  `docs/frontend/sandicts-google-one-tap-experience.md`

Prototype tasks:

- `[UX] Prototype sign-in screen`
- `[UX] Prototype expired session state`
- `[UX] Prototype auth error state`

Implementation tasks:

- deployment path is validated

## Current Open Decision Backlog

Resolved foundation decisions:

- frontend repository location: `sandicts/reactjs-sandicts-web`
- local frontend path: `apps/reactjs-sandicts-web`
- frontend runtime: Node.js 24 LTS with npm 11
- local ports: API on `3000`, frontend on `3001`
- OpenAPI generator: Orval as the initial MVP generator
- API/OpenAPI integration architecture: generated OpenAPI code is a contract
  adapter under `lib/api`, with a semantic Sandicts API runtime, feature hooks,
  in-memory access token storage, backend-owned refresh cookies, normalized
  backend errors, and TanStack Query server-state ownership
- auth session hydration flow: browser bootstrap uses `POST /auth/refresh`,
  current session reads use `GET /auth/me`, access tokens stay in memory, and
  refresh tokens stay backend-owned in `HttpOnly` cookies
- KAN-65 navigation model: single login, one user identity, multiple contexts,
  context switcher, first-class Player/Organization/Academy/Admin App areas,
  and slug-based routes from the start
- KAN-66 mobile navigation model: compact public header, five-destination
  Player bottom navigation, operational navigation sheets, grouped mobile
  context switcher, medium rails, expanded sidebars, and URL-owned selection
- Organization and Academy model: Organization owns venue/unit/court operations;
  Academy owns training/class/coach/student operations; they are independent
  contexts that can belong to the same signed-in user

Frontend foundation:

- generated API client implementation from the documented architecture
- deployment target
- CI checks and commands

UX and app shell:

- global state templates

Auth:

- CORS and credentialed browser behavior with backend
- expired session UX
- sign-out behavior

Product and page decisions:

- exact public discovery depth before login
- visitor visibility for exact available slots
- exact MVP profile fields
- exact MVP organization profile fields
- exact Academy V2 scope and sequencing
- public-facing Portuguese labels for Organization and Academy
- billing model for organizations and academies
- pricing model for court/availability
- availability by court or by court and sport
- slot duration rules
- reservation cancellation window
- initial reservation status and organization confirmation flow
- open match place representation
- whether creator joins an open match automatically
- minimal admin need before launch

## Documentation Backlog

Track docs work explicitly.

Immediate docs tasks:

- `[Docs] Document frontend technology decisions`
- `[Docs] Create MVP delivery roadmap`
- `[Docs] Align frontend planning with decided stack`
- `[Docs] Add frontend roadmap docs to AI index`
- `[Docs] Reconcile uncommitted MVP functional and screen specs`

Recurring docs tasks:

- update page spec after each approved prototype
- update business rules when a product rule becomes a backend invariant
- update frontend planning when app architecture changes
- update Jira workflow when delivery conventions change
- update README only when setup, commands, environment, or behavior described
  there changes

## First Jira Batch Recommendation

Do not create every MVP issue at once.

Recommended first batch:

- `[Docs] Document frontend technology decisions`
- `[Docs] Create MVP delivery roadmap`
- `[Spike] Decide frontend repository location`
- `[Frontend] Decide package manager and Node.js version`
- `[Frontend] Decide OpenAPI client generator`
- `[UX] Decide player, organization, academy, and Admin App navigation model`
- `[Design] Define MVP visual tokens and component direction`
- `[UX] Prototype public, player, organization, academy, and Admin App shells`
- `[Frontend] Create Next.js app foundation`
- `[Frontend] Configure shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and lucide-react`
- `[Frontend] Configure TanStack Query and API client foundation`
- `[Frontend] Configure Playwright, Vitest, and Testing Library`

After that, detail auth and player profile only. Keep later modules as roadmap
anchors until they are close enough for decisions and prototypes.
